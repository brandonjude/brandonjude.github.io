Technology has always been an area of interest for me since I was in middle school. From the first time I picked up a camera, got my first laptop, took my first computer science class, and had my first IT helpdesk internship, I found myself constantly surrounded by technology. This motivated me to pursue a future career in technology. 

 As a college freshman, I told myself, "I'm going to be a software engineer!" The luxurious and playful office environments of big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Youtube and their extremely high salaries and benefits motivated me to pursue a position at one of these companies. 

That motivation was short-lived as I soon realized that computer programming was not something that I wanted to pursue full time. However, I still had an interest and passion for technology and wanted to pursue it for a career.

I re-evaluated the aspects of technology that I found interesting and found myself gravitating towards Information Technology and Information Systems. I enjoyed my position as an IT helpdesk intern. I enjoyed communicating with other employees and found satisfaction from the feeling of knowing that I made someone's day better by fixing their computer or printer. I found myself genuinely interested in learning about operating systems, hardware, networking, and cyber security. Most importantly, I realized I enjoyed helping people and helping them reach their goals.  

This led me to find out about the Management Information Systems major at UH Manoa. I wanted to be immersed in technology, learn how it works, and use this knowledge to help others.  

Recently, I attained the CompTIA A+ certification and am working towards my CCNA R&S certification. I want to use this knowledge and skills to become a more effective IT technician and eventually become an IT manager and directly influence the technology processes and systems of a business. I plan to become proficient in technology and gain business management skills to lead my own team.
