Why am I enrolling in a management information systems course? I am studying ITM 352 to learn about data analytics and understand how information systems help with operational decision-making. As I’ve noticed the growth of cloud computing, technology is the key to business survival. 

I have always been interested in learning new languages, and one of my main goals is to learn the languages of coding. While only understanding the surface of what MIS is about, I’ve never worked hands-on with IT in the context of business strategies. With this fascination, MIS is also paired well with my marketing major, since both involve gathering and analyzing data.

As I am currently using WIX for my portfolio and internship, I realized that some tasks would be more convenient if I could implement code, such as changing the format of CTAs on every blog post at once. Instead of manually making changes, inserting a string that automatically makes the changes would save plenty of time. Moreover, I aim to gain technical skills in this class to create access and solve problems.
